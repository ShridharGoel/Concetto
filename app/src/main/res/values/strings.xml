Experience the world of construction in a miniature form by constructing a Truss Bridge. Truss Bridge is the type of bridge whose main element is a truss, which is a structure of connected elements that form triangular units.\n
        Truss is used because it is very rigid structure and it transfers the load from single point to much wider area and are economic to construct. But the closed bridges provide obstacle for better transportation along the river.\n
        To overcome this hurdle, the new concept called HYDRAULIC ASSISTED BRIDGE (HAB) is used that provides the feasible transportation.\n

REWARD CRITERIA
    </string>
    <string name="flashabout">
        Here is the mission for you. The robot you make has to play a crucial role. The mission is to carry THE SECRET CODES from CODE_SQUARE to DATA_RING. You do not have much time. The clock is ticking fast. Should you choose to accept it?\n

        <b>PROBLEM STATEMENT</b>\n
 Teams have to build an autonomous bot that can follow a white line over a coloured surface to move between the different zones and perform the required tasks.\nThe arena will consist of the Starting Zone (SZ), Code Square (CS), Data Ring (DR) and timers T1 and T2.\n The bot will start from the SZ and follow the thick white path. It will reach the CS where it has to identify a set of operators (+, -, x, %) and operands (a, b, c), where a, b, c are small integers encoded using combinations of LEDs.\n The mapping of operators and operands to LEDs of CS are shown clearly in table 1. The bot has to calculate that arithmetic expression. Once it has done its work at CS, it has to move to DR, where it shall transmit of evaluated result(magnitude only) of expression using its binary equivalent with the help of a set of 5-LEDs (An ON LED will represent ‘1’ and an OFF LED will represent ‘0’).\n\n
        <b>Guidelines and Suggestions</b>
1)	Along with an Arduino board, make use of light detecting sensors like photo-diode, light-dependent resistor (LDR), photo-transistors, LEDs.\n
2)	Strictly follow the dimensions of CODE_SQUARE and place your sensors accordingly to get accurate readings and prevent misalignments.\n
3)	The codes given by CODE_SQUARE will change on the spot i.e. they will be different for different bots. Thus, the bot should be programmed to adapt according to every possible code given.
    </string>
    <string name="flashtasks">
        <b>Level 1:</b>
The first task will check the bot’s locomotion capabilities. The bot will have to travel path by following the thick white line. The bots who are successfully able to do this will qualify this stage.
Bot should complete this level without any human intervention. In case of any human intervention the respective penalties will be awarded.
Maximum time limit: 10 minutes.\n
Points awarded: \n\n
•	50 points on completion of level.\n
•	-5 for each human intervention.\n

<b>Level 2:</b>
The Second level is where the real challenge begins. The bot will start from SZ and travel the path to reach CS. Now according to table 1, decode the code given through LED’s and convert it into a meaningful arithmetic expression and then calculate the value and store that value as it will be used later. Also, initially all the 4 LED’s will be ON for the bot to properly align itself to take those readings. Make sure that after the bot has stopped on CS it signals in the form of an external LED after which the code will be exposed (refer note 1). After taking the readings from CS the bot will move to DR where it will display the calculated output number in the form of binary which is advised to be done with the help of 5-LEDs placed in a line (array) on the bot.
Maximum time limit: 15 minutes.\n
Points awarded:\n\n
•	20 points for stopping at CS.\n
•	20 points for successfully collecting data from CS.\n
•	10 points for crossing to path break.\n
•	15 points for successfully crossing ‘L’ junction.\n
•	70 points for displaying correct answer at DR.\n
•	-5 points for touch for each physical contact.\n
        <b>Note1:</b>
Initially all the LEDs of CS will be on, in order to help the bot properly align. The bot must signal only after it has properly aligned.\n

<b>Tie-breaker Level:</b>\n\n
This level will be open only for those team whose points are coincident and in top three scores. Quantitative tie-breaking strategies will be employed. The strategies will be disclosed on the spot.\n


    </string>
    <string name="flashrules">
        1)	Only one bot per team is allowed.\n
2)	A team can have a maximum of 4 members.\n
3)	Sharing or exchanging of bots within teams is not allowed.\n
4)	Explicit physical contact with the bot during the course of the event is not allowed without the organizer’s permission. Doing so can lead to a penalty or even disqualification.\n
5)	In case the bot leaves the defined track, the respective team will have to restart from the Starting Zone.\n
6)	Each participant has to bring his/her Identity Proof to be checked by the organizers at the time of the event.
